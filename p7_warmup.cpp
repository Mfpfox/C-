/*
Try declaring the health member function private instead of public, and make sure you understand the resulting compilation error.
 =if int health() const is in private... you cant access it in the main function
 
 
Comment out the entire implementation of Pet::eat, all the way from the void Pet::eat(int amt) to its close curly brace. Make sure you understand the resulting build error.

 
 
In main, try replacing myPets[0] = new Pet("Fluffy", 2); with myPets[0] = new Pet("Fluffy"); or myPets[0] = new Pet;, and make sure you understand the resulting compilation error.
 =you could make a constructor to fit only a name argument
 =for default you can declare the default as new pet; or new pet();
 can have many different constructors...one will have to be default with no parameters
 
 
Try removing the const from the implementation, but not the declaration of the alive member function. Notice the compilation error.
 
 
Try removing the const from both the declaration and the implementation of the alive member function. Make sure you understand why the use of that function doesn't compile in reportStatus, but does compile in careFor and main.

 
 *******if you dont have const at end of function, and you pass a pointer that is suppose to point at a const object...its considered by compiler that you have potential to change the object its an error....keep everything const within const
CS 31 THERE WILL NOT BE A CONSTANT POINTER...SO IF CONFUSED KNOW ITS THE OBJECT IT POINTS TOO THAT IS CONSTANT.
